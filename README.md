# Install

2. Heroku link is provided in the GitHub repository if you would like to use it immediately without installing the code base.

# Learned

In this challenge I got quite a bit more experience with express and understanding how to handle routes. I was glad that I had the experience of struggling with getting the notes to populate the left side of the page since it created a good problem solving oppurtunity to better understand the spread operator.
